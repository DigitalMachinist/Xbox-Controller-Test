Health
======

Part of the [unity-utilities](https://github.com/DigitalMachinist/unity-utilities) GitHub repo by [@DigitalMachinist](https://github.com/DigitalMachinist).

The ```Health``` class represents an object with health that can be destroyed and potentially revived. It handles the obvious role of keeping track of current HP, but also provides systems to apply regenerative and degenerative effects over time and exposes a complete set of events that allow other parts of the application respond to health events of a particular object. Furthermore, this health system supports "supercharge" heals, special heal actions that can increase the object's health beyond the normal max HP value up to the "Super Max HP".

This library is compatible with both Unity Free and Unity Pro and should run on Unity versions back to 3.x (and possibly earlier).

**Note:** This library depends on the ```FoldableEvent``` class (also contained in this repo).
